            <h1>Tomorrow Never Came...</h1>
            <h2>by Lana del Rey and Sean Ono Lennon</h2>
            <p>"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot<br>
                Shakin' and movin' at my local spot<br>
                Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why<br>
                Why, why, why, why, why, why, why</p>
            <p>Lay, lady, lay<br>
                On that side of a paradise<br>
                In the Tropic of Cancer<br>
                'Cause if I had my way<br>
                You would always stay<br>
                And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey</p>
            <p>I waited for you<br>
                In the spot you said to wait<br>
                In the city, on the park bench<br>
                In the middle of the pourin' rain<br>
                'Cause I adored you<br>
                I just wanted things to be the same<br>
                You said to meet me up there tomorrow<br>
                But tomorrow never came<br>
                Tomorrow never came</p>
